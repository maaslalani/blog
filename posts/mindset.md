# Mindset

Imagine a car traveling 50 kilometers per hour north, and a truck traveling 75 kilometers per hour south, and you standing off to the side of the road, observing. To you, the car and truck are simply traveling 50 kilometers per hour north and 75 kilometers per hour south, respectively. However, to the person sitting inside the car, the truck looks as though it is traveling 125 kilometers per hour south. To the person sitting inside the truck it looks as though the car is traveling 125 kilometers north.

Everything is relative; it depends on your frame of reference. Different observers see different things if they are in different reference frames. The same theory applies to mindsets. Any given situation can be interpreted wildly differently depending on the observer. What matters is the observer's mindset.

A mindset is a fixed mental attitude or disposition that predetermines a person's responses to and interpretations of situations.

A person who tends to recognize themselves as a victim of the negative actions of others. In every situation, the person who has the victim mindset always assumes that the other has harmed or attacked them in some way. Even if this is the case, this mindset trait does not help in any situation.

"Choose not to be harmed — and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed — and you haven't been."

Not assuming harm can be an amazing way to not become responsible for your actions and even the actions of others, instead of always feeling discouraged. Instead of being a victim, be a person who can endure pain or hardship without showing their feelings or complaining.

A person who always sees failure in every opportunity is bound to fail or, even worse, will never try. Having a fearful mindset is detrimental to all opportunities since all opportunities have inherent risks. Observing only the risks and being fearful of any opportunities will result in the avoidance of any positive life decisions.

For example, never starting to workout since you might get injured lifting weights, or never starting the business you have always dreamt of because you fear it might fail.

One should strive for a dreamer mindset and aim to see the benefits in any opportunity, while still evaluating risks. Then, should make a decision based on the benefits and risks whether to pursue the opportunity.
