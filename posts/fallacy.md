# Fallacy

In the world, there are so many decisions to be made. There are so many arguments to be made.

To navigate through all this, we need to be careful of fallacies. A fallacy, so I've learned, is a flaw is reasoning. It disguises itself as valid logic, but we should be careful of it because they are simply not logical.

There are probably hundreds of different fallacies and it doesn't make sense to remember all of them.

The strategy I am going to follow is to be more critical of the things I read or listen to, especially persuasive arguments.

Critical thinking is important because as humans we can easily be manipulated.

Appeals to our emotion as the sole basis of supporting reasons is an example of a fallacy.

On the other side, I will also try to be more open-minded to the things I read or listen to. This is because of a fallacy called Ad Hominem, which is to attack someone's character as the sole reasoning of dismissing their argument. I am definitely guilty of this.

Not listening to someone's potentially sound argument simply because they are saying it. Whereas, if someone else says the exact same argument you may agree with them.

I will try to not dismiss someone's argument immediately, but rather try to understand what they are arguing and whether it makes sense.

I have probably missed out on some sound advice simply because I didn't like the person it was coming from. The advice should be assessed independently from the person giving it. Although, you may be more critical and skeptical depending on the person, but I will try not to simply dismiss their claims.

I think this strategy will make me a better thinker maybe, if I am lucky, a better person.

We shouldn't decide everything by polling the masses. This is the fallacy argumentum ad numerum, the idea that something is true because great numbers believe it, as in
