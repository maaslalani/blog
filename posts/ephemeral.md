# Ephemeral

Life is fleeting. It is ephemeral in nature. The more and more I study philosophy the more that this simple fact is becoming engrained in my ephemeral brain. Funnily enough I don't really find this alarming at all. I find it very freeing. Nothing actually matters. Of course, this is somewhat of a dangerous fact. It can result in different courses of actions among different people and totally different responses can emerge.

One of my favourite Steve Jobs quotes is where he talks about death and his choices in life:
> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

Although it's kind of weird to think about death, I try and think about it in the most positive way. I use it to help me do things and make life choices. A constant reminder of it is somewhat scary but it also strangely enough causes me to worry less. All the little things that I would worry or stress about seem to fade away. I am just trying to live the most meaningful life (whatever that means) I can.

We are all just trying to make sense of the world. Something that has been interesting to me for the past few years is learning about how people make sense of the world. I started learning about schools of philosophy and try to follow (and usually fail) stoicism. All of them are very interesting and have some overlap. But following stoicism (trying my best) is most certainly the reason I can reason to myself about some of the questions I have, how I decide to act, and the decisions that I make.
