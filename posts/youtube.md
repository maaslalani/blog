# YouTube

You can tell a lot about someone just from looking at their YouTube feed. The content they consume and what they watch in their pass time. It's honestly one of my favourite pieces of software ever made. It has enabled me to learn so much and made information absurdly accessible. It's how I learned coding and began writing software. It's the reason I got great marks in highschool. It's the reason I know how to invest and manage money. It's taught me a lot that school never did. Some of my best teachers are from YouTube. One interesting thing I noticed was that my subscriptions look almost entirely different than they did five years ago. I would have loved for a list of my subscriptions as almost a snapshot of time for my fifteen year old self. So, I am writing this to freeze time. To show my future self what sorts of videos I watched in the past. It will be interesting to see how my YouTube feed changes in the future. Maybe YouTube won't even exist in the future, who knows? A lot can change.

Also, I recently discovered [lbry.tv](https://lbry.tv/) which is a decentralized alternative for YouTube. I hope this gets big.
