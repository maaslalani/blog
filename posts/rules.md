# Rules

I used to not like rules. I always thought they were limiting. The problem I had was actually (or so I think) with instructions that disguised themselves as rules. Instructions don't always sit well with me for creative tasks. I really prefer experimentation. It's simply more enjoyable for me.

Following instructions kind of kills the fun. It takes you from one point to the other and gives you the result you wanted. This seems like a good thing (and usually is) but the problem is that it removes the sort of process that makes you struggle to come up with the way to get from one point to the other. Sometimes this is what I want. I think though I will start to avoid these instructions on tasks or activities that I want to struggle with.

An obvious example that comes to my mind are board games. A classic board game like Monopoly or likewise has a solid foundation of strategy that I could follow to have a better chance at winning games. There are strategies like buying each property you land on, staying in Jail for longer to avoid landing on other people's properties and having to pay rent and other stuff. There is even a [WikiHow article](https://www.wikihow.com/Win-at-Monopoly) written about it. When I use to play Monopoly with friends, I just memorized these rules to win. It took all the fun out of developing my own strategies and play styles.

Luckily, as I play new things and do activities I've tried to not follow instructions. But rather develop my own thinking and methods to try and reach optimal solutions. It's just more fun this way. Like a really hard math problem, for example, its very easy to just look up the solution but arriving at the solution by myself gives me a lot more satisfaction.

Realizing this, I now actually love rules. I think they make me more creative, or at least they help me actually make progress.
Without rules I think I would just be paralyzed with options.
