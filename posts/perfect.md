# Perfect

Nothing is perfect. I don't believe anything can be perfect either. Things can, however, be good enough. This is one belief that somehow helps me do things. Even if it is not true, it still helps me do things. Writing this, for example, if perfection was achievable it would take me years to write this, or however long it takes to be perfect. I think even art masterpieces aren't perfect. They, again, are just good enough to be masterpieces. Obviously, there is a spectrum of quality. Some blog posts should not be shared, some paintings should not be shown, and some apps or websites should not be published. But, once you pass the good enough bar, let them loose. Otherwise, there will never be progress. I suggest to myself to have a bias for shipping. Get things out the door and receive feedback. Then, try again or move on to the next thing.

> Done is better than perfect.

I think of the concept of perfection a lot like I think about Infinity in math. It's possible in theory and I understand it exists but it's only a concept. Imagine I asked you to count to infinity. You would never stop saying numbers. You would just be standing there forever. Infinity isn't neccessary if 100 is good enough. This thinking has helped me a lot in practice. I've stopped attempting to count to infinity. There are better things to do.

Versioning stuff is a very beneficial concept that I use. When trying to create, I attempt a version 1. Once that is done, I think about what's missing. Version 2 comes if I think the previous iteration is not good enough, and I repeat. I think about it like counting by skipping numbers. Counting to a thousand is a lot easier if your interval is 100.

This is probably what version 1 would look like:

> 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 700, 800, 900, 1000.

Then version 2 would be the same but maybe using 10 as the interval. I usually never get that far because version 1 is likely good enough. It's comforting to know that I can iterate if neccessary, though.

I think I just need to be good enough.
