# Momentum

> Objects in motion stay in motion, objects at rest stay at rest, unless an external force acts upon them.

~ Isaac Newton

Momentum is essential for doing things. Once a task is complete, there is momentum for completing another task. Once you do the first push up, the second one isn't so difficult. After the first step, you can go on a run.

Applying this law of motion from physics to life is an interesting way to see how the human mind and body work.

Now onto rest, have you ever noticed it's almost impossible to have just one chip, or one scoop of ice cream? It's nearly impossible to watch just one episode of your favorite TV show. Seldom do we ever actually mean "just one more."

The key takeaway from having momentum is that there must be a will to get into motion. That way, the object will stay in motion as per the laws of physics. However, following the rules is no fun. Break the laws of physics that say objects in motion stay in motion, objects at rest stay at rest, unless an **external** force acts upon them.

Create an **internal** force.

Just get started.
