# Launch

I launched 5 products in 5 weeks. Here is what I learned.

## Minimum Viable Product

It is essential, when shipping products, to focus. It would be lovely if every week I could ship a perfect product with all the features included. That's just not possible. When putting an emphasis on getting products out there will always be sacrifices. It usually was the extra features that would be nice to have but weren't necessary that were sacrificed. For example, when launching our very first product *[Remove Vanity Metrics](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/remove-vanity-metrics)* we agreed that it would be nice to have all social media included. However, we decided to go with only removing metrics from twitter and said we could always keep adding more social media in later versions. Whenever you think of a new feature, analyze whether it is really necessary for the main value proposition. If it isn't, there can always be a version two. We found it helpful to not dismiss new feature ideas right away but rather reserve them for version two.

## Stellar team

Having a stellar team helps out a lot. Sure, hard work alone will get you far but working hard and having an amazing team will get you further.

Naval said it best.

## Return on Investment

When coming up with ideas and deciding which ones to pursue we would always analyze return on investment. We used it as the primary indicator whether an idea was worth building and shipping. Essentially, we were looking for ideas that were easy to build and wouldn't take long and that would be useful to many people and get lots of traction. These ideas would low investment of our resources for a potential high return.

For example, our [first product](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/remove-vanity-metrics) was inspired from a tweet made by Kanye West.

We chose to build it out because it wouldn't take that long and the potential return was huge. If Kanye found our product then it would be in front of his 28.7 million followers. Sadly, Kanye didn't notice our product but we were fortunate enough to get a small feature on [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/twitter-should-kill-retweet/574321/?ref=producthunt), exposing our product to millions of readers.

We followed this practice of optimizing return on investment religiously. We always discussed how to spend less time on a product and get the most return out of it. In fact, our latest product, [Founder Rewind](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/founder-rewind), which was always our most upvoted product took the least time to make.

## Momentum

I think momentum was the only reason that we were able to ship a product every week for 5 weeks. There was a strong sense of inertia after each launch. Every launch fuelled our creativity and motivation for the next project. Constantly we would discuss our next ideas on slack as to not lose the great momentum we had.

I wrote a small piece on [momentum](https://medium.com/@maaslalani/momentum-16360bd68f9) while we were shipping products as I recognized how crucial it was to our whole process.

## Practice makes perfect

As cliché as this may sound, it is true. It just seems to be a law of nature that you need to repeat something to get better at it. There's no way to *learn* how to launch a product. It's just a thing you have to do. It's just a muscle you have to exercise, and the more you launch the stronger the muscle will be.

In our case, our first product, [Remove Vanity Metrics](http://producthunt.com/posts/remove-vanity-metrics) finished in as the #5 product of the day on Product Hunt. After iterating several product launches our latest launch, Founder Rewind finished as the #1 product of the day. The results may not be as linear as these but there will be significant improvements.

Our first launch, [Remove Vanity Metrics](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/remove-vanity-metrics) and second launch, [Just Focus](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/just-focus-4151b38d-62a0-4b51-97cb-686565991438), were launched only a week apart from each other. After just one iteration of launching we discovered many of the things we did wrong and tried to improve them.

## Be sustainable

I think it's undeniably easy to sacrifice the wrong things in life to work on projects. Don't do this because it is not sustainable.

Here are some things that are more important than your side projects. Don't neglect these to launch your next product.

- Sleep
- Health
- Relationships

Here are some things that you *should* sacrifice to create side projects

- Watching TV
- Mindlessly scrolling through social media

We often make the mistake to prioritize the urgent over the important. Don't do this. The important things in life should be held at a greater importance than the urgent in most cases. During the 5 weeks of product launches I avoided watching TV and deleted Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. This saved me around 2–5 hours per day, which I then invested in these 5 products. Make sure you know what is important to you and never sacrifice it for the urgency of anything.

Overall, this experience was amazing and super fun. I learned an insane amount. I can't wait to launch more products.
