# Game

I have always thought about life as a game.

The more I think about it the more I think that this is the case. I've tried to make a list of the similarities between life and video games as clear as possible to myself.

Thinking about story lines, a crucial part of any video game, life is similar. However, there are some obvious differences. Any good game, along with any life, has a strong purpose. While game makers often define the purpose of the games for us, life is not like this. I find myself constantly thinking about life's purpose. Currently (this changes often) I believe it is to help people. Often when I do things now it is usually to bring people joy or some form of positive emotions. I think this logic stems from equating helping people to having an impact which is one of my goals.

Video games usually have adventures where you have to make choices along the way. These decisions can have amazing or detrimental results, so you must choose carefully. I draw this parallel to life in terms of your career, love, and health. Choosing a life partner and career are probably the two most important decisions of your life. They affect happiness and even longevity.

Just like video games, you can choose to play life with different play styles. Some people play games to compete, others very casually for fun. A small subset of people even play games trying to optimize for speed, in other words, speed running. This decision of how you want to play life is entirely up to you. I think the best way to play is to switch around play styles and have different play styles depending what is happening. You should probably be competitive in a race, but enjoy learning at school. Speed running could be useful to try and optimize boring tasks or chores like laundry. Make it a game to see how fast you can do these things.

Life is filled with characters. Whether life is a single-player game or a multi-player game is something I struggle with. Currently, I believe that life is a _single-player_ video game, but I often switch between. If it is single-player, then there are three classes of characters, player, non-player characters (NPC) and enemies. You play as the player and interact with NPCs, while fighting enemies. Enemies don't necessarily have to be player equivalents. Homework can be an enemy, mental health issues can be enemies, technology can be an enemy.

Like any good (or bad) game, life has cheat-codes. Currently, I have found that reading, learning, and creating are cheat-codes. No special character combination to enter or anything special.
