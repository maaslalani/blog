# Eyesight

One day, on the subway as my mind wandered, as it usually does when I forget my earphones and cannot listen to music, I started staring at advertisements. I silently reflected on the use of colour these advertisements had and started to appreciate them a little more.

A few moments later, I became incredibly happy as I observed the world around me. I started to notice just how many strangers I've seen and how many I would never see again. Every now and then I'd see the same stranger repeatedly. I always wondered if they recognized me as well.

As I was making eye contact with other public transit riders, I saw an old lady entering the train. My heart somewhat broke as I felt her struggling to find the empty seat in front of her. She was blind and could not immediately find the open spot where she could sit down. I began feeling overwhelmed with emotions.

I was somewhat frustrated with myself.

Everyday, I wake up and have never thankful for my eyesight. The following day I started smiling uncontrollably every time I saw any object, animal, or person.

I intend to be thankful for my eyesight everyday.

> I opened two gifts this morning. They were my eyes.
