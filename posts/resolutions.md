# Resolutions

I have always loved January, especially new years day. This year, however, I'm not going to set any resolutions. I have no expectations for this year.

- Drink more water
- Get more sleep

Pretty lame. So, I am trying something different this year.

Here are my resolutions for this year:

Let's see if I can keep them.
