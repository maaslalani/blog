# Simplify

I am trying to simplify my life. It seems as though complicated and unnecessary decision making wastes mental energy and time. As much as I can reduced these, the better. I have made several strides in order to simplify my life.

## Remove the Unnecessary

An approach to simplifying your life is simply to get rid of what is not needed. Having less means less to worry about. Many people refer to the as minimalism or essentialism. Whatever you call it, do it. It works wonders.

I started off with the items I encounter everyday: my phone, laptop, and room.

As you can see, there are no social media apps on my phone. This is probably one of the best decisions I've made. While difficult at first, this decision allowed me to free up lots time which is the reason I decided to simplify my life in the first place. The average person will spend approximately 116 minutes every day on social media. Making this change in my life has saved me about 2 hours daily, let alone all the mental health benefits of quitting.

I did roughly the same with my laptop. Eliminate any apps I felt I did not need. My philosophy was to delete as much as I could. If I made a mistake, it was not hard to download the app again.

For my room, I set aside a few hours to clean it. I emptied out all the closets and drawers. I donated clothes that I had not worn in a while and threw out old papers and anything I did not need. I found that I by removing so many things my room became much cleaner and easier to maintain.

## Create Routines

We make a lot of decisions everyday. Most of these decisions are utterly useless and simply waste brain processing power. Various internet sources estimate that an adult makes about 35,000 remotely conscious decisions each day.

What should I wear today?

Do these pants match my shirt?

Should I go to the gym today?

Should I have milk or orange juice?

Analyzing many successful individuals such as Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Barack Obama we quickly see how they approach decision making.

Barack Obama once stated:

> *You'll see, I wear only gray or blue suits. I'm trying to pare down decisions. I don't want to make decisions about what I'm eating or wearing, because I have too many other decisions to make.*

Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg wear the same outfit everyday to reduce the decisions they make. This, in turn, leads to further simplification of the frequency and time spent shopping and doing laundry. This is why it is imperative to reduce decisions as they are very closely tied to other areas in our life and can have significant chain reactions for saving time. Think about saving 5 minutes not choosing your outfit in the morning, going to the mall once per year as opposed to once a month, doing laundry once a month instead of once a week.

You would save around 64 hours and 25 minutes per year.

Personally, I have made some rules that allow me to make fewer decisions everyday. My meals are generally preplanned. On weekends, I have 2 scrambled eggs for breakfast and on weekdays I have bagels or yogurt and berries. I am fortunate enough where my work provides lunch, so I do not have to decide where or what I eat. The entire week's food is planned out for me and is different everyday.

Another rule I have made is to always take the stairs as opposed to the elevator or escalators. This probably does not save me anytime in the short term because taking an elevator is probably faster. However, the health benefits make it worth it and I do not waste mental processing power deciding which to take all the time. I will always take the stairs. 

A small thing I have noticed is that due to humans being habitual creatures, we create routines unconsciously sometimes. Since I take the bus to work in the mornings, I have noticed I always gravitate towards the same seat. Sitting in a different spot feels unusual. So every time I get on the bus I do not have to ask myself where I will sit.

I intend to also wear the same outfit everyday, eventually.

## Eliminate Distractions

Doing this will create a lot more energy so that you can tackle the problem you want to focus on, instead of being distracted and unfocused.

*Turn off notifications* from any apps on your phone that are not necessary and unwanted. It is hard to do anything like study, read, or work while you are constantly bombarded with notifications throughout the day. It is even difficult to do nothing while these tiny red badges try to lure you to open their app.

*Say no more often.* Say no to activities and choices that do not align with your values and goals. If your goal is to build a good physique say no to that bag of chips. If your goal is to get an A+ on your test tomorrow say no to watching youtube videos for 4 hours straight. If you want to work in the software industry, say no to opportunities that may seem good but are not aligned with your end goal in mind. Say no to distractions. Saying no allows you to focus and make progress more quickly and more simply, with less detours, to your goals.

## Be Simple

In order to simplify your life, you must also try to be simple as a person. Something I am trying to adapt is pure honesty. Pure honesty allows me to not waste mental processing power by keep thoughts in my head or having to remember to whom I said what. Although, I have a lot to work on in this regard, simple improvements do make significant changes. Another benefit of being honest allows you to avoid coming up with excuses. You just have to tell the truth, no exaggerations.

Another way to be simple is to identify what makes you happy, and focus on optimizing time spent on those activities.

I attempted to make a list of 5 activities that I love doing. 

- Coding
- Exercise
- Acts of kindness
- Spending time with close friends
- Listening to music

You can do the same thing with activities you do not like doing and avoid them. Identifying a few things that make you happy and sad can help you direct yourself to a more positive mood. Having fewer and fewer items on these lists can make it easy to select which items to do and not do, leaving you with fewer decisions.

## Want Less

By wanting less you learn to appreciate what you already have instead of longing for that which you do not. Instead of desiring more material possessions, express gratitude for your [eyesight](https://medium.com/@maaslalani/eyesight-764d15041ee5), hearing, and your breathing. Imagine, just for a moment, your life where you desire very little. You enjoy simple, free pleasures like a long walk in nature, reading, writing, laughing. Through wanting less, we buy less. We incur less debt, less clutter, less responsibility. It's simple, but difficult. Consciously wanting less starts with being aware that you already have enough. 

Removing the unnecessary, creating routines, eliminating distractions, being simple and wanting less has allowed me to live a simpler and overall happier life. I intend to pursue [minimalism](https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/) in attempt to live an even simpler life. While I have made some progress, I still have a long way to go.
