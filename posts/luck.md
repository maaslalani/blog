# Luck

I believe that luck is a fallacy.

When someone is successful in life, people and sometimes myself, are quick to dismiss their success as a result of being lucky. This discounts all of their hard work as though they did not earn what they were given. When in fact, all they did was play the odds.

I am convinced that life, in its simplest form, is a series of events that stem from choices each associated with potential benefits and potential risks.

Living a successful life, therefore, is as simple as exposing oneself to *asymmetric opportunities,* that is to say opportunities with as much associated potential benefit with the least associated potential risk. Even doing so may result in several failures since there is no guarantee anything will succeed. However, repeatedly exposing oneself to these opportunities is a surefire way to achieve success.

Examples of asymmetric opportunities include starting a company, reading books, writing a book, recording a podcast or video, creating a software product, asking a stranger out, lifting weights.

Reading a book has its inherent risks, if the book was terrible and you learned absolutely nothing out of it, it was a waste of the number of hours you spent reading it. This risk is a small price to pay considering that a book has the potential to change one's life. The right book could inspire one to invest, start a business, teach one life skills, and make one happy. Let's say the probability of you reading an awful book is one in twenty-five, twenty-four books were a good use of time. If the probability of reading a life-changing book is one in two hundred, that is simply the number of books you must read to change your life.

Lifting weights is similar, every time someone works out they run the slight risk of becoming injured. Meanwhile, lifting weight has massive upsides should you not become injured such as improved posture, better sleep, more confidence, gaining bone density, maintaining weight loss, boosting metabolism, and lowering inflammation. Simply consistently working out is a surefire way to get lucky.

Along with asymmetric opportunities there are their counterparts, asymmetric risks. These are actions with very little potential benefit with an enormous amount of associated potential risk. One example of this is texting while driving.

I think it is easy to attribute the success of others to luck, I believe the reason I even sometimes do this is to create an excuse for not working harder and remain being comfortable with our current state. By believing in luck, one can easily dismiss the work of others and feel satisfied by doing the bare minimum because they are simply not lucky. By not believing in luck, one can feel motivated by seeing the hard work and preparation behind the success of others, and then proceeding to do the same. All that is necessary is to play the odds.

> I am a great believer in luck. The harder I work, the more of it I seem to have.
