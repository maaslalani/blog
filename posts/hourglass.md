# Hourglass

We all are going to die.

This simple fact of life is obvious; yet many of us, sometimes myself included, choose to be oblivious to it. In this case, ignorance seems to be bliss.

It is important however to remind ourselves that we are going to die ~~someday~~. In fact, we do not die someday. Rather, every day a part of us dies.

Imagine an hourglass. It is born by being flipped upside down. It starts to pour down sand grain by grain. It does not suddenly die once the last grain of sand has fallen. It is dying slowly, with each grain of sand.

We are dying as soon as we are born.

Death is the timer which challenges us. How much can we accomplish before the last grain of sand drops?

Embracing the inevitable helps us achieve that which we want out of life.
Whatever you want to do, do it now. There are only so many tomorrows.

If there is one thing death teaches us, it is not to waste time.

> Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.
