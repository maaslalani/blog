I am writing this in a new keyboard layout that I am trying to learn.

It is painfully slow. I think it is going to be worth it. I am also learning touch typing at the same time. There are a lot of bad habits to unlearn and good habits to pick up. I feel like I am learning typing for the first time, which is a good thing. At the same time, it's very difficult.

I just need to practice everyday.
