# Butterfly

Everyday, I make decisions. I'm not very good at them yet, but I'm learning. I try to pick up new insights like how cognitive biases hinder decision making and how flaws in reasoning can lead to poor judgment.

I was recently introduced to [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory). As I understand it chaos theory tries to explain complex systems. It suggests that some complex systems may actually be entirely deterministic and only *seem* random. Determinism means that given an input the system will produce an output, and it will reproduce the output, if given the exact same input. In other words, the input determines the output. The underlying insight of chaos theory is that even the slightest changes of the initial can produce drastically different results.

How this was discovered and eventually formalized was that someone (Edward Lorenz) used a few deterministic equations to model a basic weather simulation. Given the *exact* same starting conditions the simulation would run in the exact same way. This was expected since the system is entirely deterministic. Because the simulation would determine the atmospheric conditions at any given iteration, you could also use the atmospheric conditions at any iteration to continue the simulation as if it started from the beginning. What ended up happening was a small rounding error of 6 decimal places to 3 decimal places after a few iterations began completely deviating from the expected results since this system was deterministic.

Rounding off a few variables by a seemingly insignificant amount changed the future of the system in a very significant way.

After learning about this theory and its discovery, I learned more about a term that I would often hear: [the butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect).

From what I've read the butterfly effect is untrue, butterflies probably don't cause tornadoes, but still a useful mental model for thinking about Chaos Theory. Such small dependencies can entirely change outcomes of large systems. Seemingly insignificant changes can have enormous impacts.

I hope to use this information as a way to take care of all my decisions, because the little things matter. On the other hand, I also need to be careful to avoid the [slippery slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope) fallacy. Just because small first step can lead to a significant effect, it is not correct to use this as an argument of logic. This would imply you can predict the future.

The future is unpredictable. Nature is chaotic.

Small changes make a big difference.
