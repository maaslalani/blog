# Chess

The game of chess has been around for over 2000 years. In the relatively short 5 years since I have been playing the beloved board game, it has taught me some invaluable lessons that relate to life.

## Learn to Create Opportunities

In chess, as in life, it is foolish to wait for opportunities to come to you. One must learn the process of creating opportunities for themselves. Learn to play with the pieces they are given. A player must make moves on the board to unlock the potential of its other pieces. For example, the most common move at the beginning of any chess game is moving the white pawn to E4. This is because it unleashes the potential of two very key pieces right off the very first move: the white queen and a white bishop.

It is essential that this same logic be applied in life. Make moves that create opportunities. Do not wait around for them.

Sometimes we see pieces that do not need to be unlocked, such as the knight. These pieces can overcome any obstacle that lies in front of them. We should all aspire to be knights for ourselves and pawns for others.

## Making Sacrifices

A gambit is an essential concept in the world of chess. It is defined as the giving up or sacrifice of a piece or a combination of pieces to gain a more strategical position and be better off in the long term. I recall, during one of my favourite games of chess I've played, I noticed how neatly my pieces aligned. There was a checkmate opportunity, if only the king was one square to the right. I started to wonder how I could incentivize my opponent to move to this square. Since one of my knights was attacking that square I thought to move it away from the action so that I could potentially force the king to move there. I stopped to think for a second. What if moving the knight away made me lose my positional advantage? I decided to do something risky. I moved my knight to the square right beside the king. If my opponent thought I made a mistake then he would simply take the knight and think he was winning. I made the move, Knight to C5. Even after a look of utter confusion from my opponent and those watching my game, I was still confident. He took my Knight with his King, King captures Knight on C5. I felt relieved, I had won the game, but during this time my opponent thought he was winning. After two more moves, I had checkmated his King and won. All due to the sacrifice of my Knight. In life, there will always be an opportunity to win. There will be trade-offs and sacrifices that you must make. To get something you want, you will have to know when to let go. Sometimes people will look at you confused and ask why you gave up your Knight. If that happens, just sit quiet and be patient. They will congratulate you once you've won the game.

## Thinking Ahead

To win a game of chess you must think 1 move ahead of your opponent. Think long-term, build long-term, prepare for the long-term, avoid distractions, and seize any opportunity you see. If you play right and think long-term, the opportunities will come. In chess it is always more important to think about end game rather than mid-game. As in life, while it is important to think about the next 10 years of your life, make decisions where you consider the last 10 years of your life.

## The Journey is Important

If you stop to think about the game of chess, there are only three possible outcomes. White wins, Black wins, or there is a draw. However, we rarely play chess for the outcome. We play chess for the nearly infinite journeys that can emerge. After both players move, 400 possible board setups exist. After the second pair of turns, there are 197, 742 possible games, and after just the first three moves, 121 million. If all we cared about was the outcome, it would be more efficient to play rock, paper, scissors. That is why one should always focus on the journey. How we get to where we want to be is what is more important than the actual goal.

## Everyone is Different

Each Member on a team brings a unique skill set. Just like how all chess pieces, together, form an incredibly strong army. All members of a team bring something to the table that should never be undervalued. Even though a pawn may hinder you at the beginning of a game, it may very well be the difference between winning and losing at the end.

No matter what, just remember that

"At the end of a game of chess, the king and pawn are put back in the same box."
