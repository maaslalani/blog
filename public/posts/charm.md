# Charm

I try to spend as much time on the command-line as possible. Whether that be editing text (with [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)), giving presentations (with [Slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides)), practicing typing (with [Typer](https://github.com/maaslalani/typer)), playing chess (with [Gambit](https://github.com/maaslalani/gambit)), or sometimes even doodling (with [Draw](https://github.com/maaslalani/draw)). I would spend my entire computing time in the command-line, if I could. I think it's such a simple and elegant platform for computing tasks. That is why I spend so much time building command-line tools.

I stumbled upon [Go](https://go.dev) and [Charm](https://charm.sh) technologies sometime last year. I have since loved using the language and the tools, which led me to build countless tools (actually, I counted. I've made nine so far!).

Some of my favourites are:

* [Slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides): Terminal based presentation tool.
* [Gambit](https://github.com/maaslalani/gambit): Play chess in your terminal.
* [Draw](https://github.com/maaslalani/draw): Draw in your terminal.
* [Confetty](https://github.com/maaslalani/confetty): Confetti in your TTY.

These tools have been useful to me and some of them have even been useful to others as well! If you, too, are a command-line enthusiast, I host the tools I build on my [GitHub](https://github.com/maaslalani).

With that said, I am so excited to announce I will be joining [Charm](https://charm.sh) to build glamorous command-line tools and interfaces. It is truly a dream come true to be working full-time and remotely on open-source tools for the command-line!

If you want to celebrate with me, go throw some [Terminal Confetti](https://github.com/maaslalani/confetty) and drink some [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).
